# Machine Learning Project in Python Step-By-Step



In this step-by-step tutorial you will:


- Load a dataset and understand itâ€™s structure using statistical summaries and data visualization.
- Create 6 machine learning models, pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable.


This is a Small End-to-End Project
Books and courses are frustrating. They give you lots of recipes and snippets, but you never get to see how they all fit together.

When you are applying machine learning to your own datasets, you are working on a project.

A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

- Define Problem.
- Prepare Data.
- Evaluate Algorithms.
- Improve Results.
- Present Results.

The best way to really come to terms with a new platform or tool is to work through a machine learning project end-to-end and cover the key steps. Namely, from loading data, summarizing data, evaluating algorithms and making some predictions.

If you can do that, you have a template that you can use on dataset after dataset. You can fill in the gaps such as further data preparation and improving result tasks later, once you have more confidence.

### Machine Learning in Python: Step-By-Step Tutorial

In this section, we are going to work through a small machine learning project end-to-end.

Here is an overview of what we are going to cover:


- Loading the dataset.
- Summarizing the dataset.
- Visualizing the dataset.
- Evaluating some algorithms.
- Making some predictions.

Take your time. Work through each step.
